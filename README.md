## Overview

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon Food Review data using a machine learning model. The sentiment analysis will classify the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project will be implemented using Scikit-Learn for building the ML model and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application.

## Data
# Amazon Fine Foods Reviews Dataset

## Overview

This dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon, spanning a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012. The dataset includes product and user information, ratings, and plain text reviews. It encompasses reviews from all other Amazon categories as well.

## Contents

- **Reviews.csv**: Extracted from the corresponding SQLite table named Reviews in database.sqlite.
- **database.sqlite**: Contains the table 'Reviews'.
